        <h2>July 9th, 20XX</h2>
    <p>Apologies to anyone who hadn't fully caught up on journal entries, but I had to burn my last drive, so it'll be a while before I can have the archive restored. In the meantime, consider this a fresh "entry number one".</p>
    <p>Not much to say this week now that you know about the new drive. Will update if anything changes.</p>
        <h2>July 16th, 20XX</h2>
    <p>Neighbourhood's getting worse by the minute. I don't think anyone's looking to cave and let the corps dig their claws into 'em just yet, but by now everyone's got the same sense that there's no relief coming, and why wouldn't they? Not like we can just get the word we knew and loved back.</p>
    <p>Every now and then I hear rumblings about people trying to take a corp or two down with hacks, but I get the feeling they're just corporate ghosts at worst, overconfident at best.</p>
       <h2>July 23rd, 20XX</h2>
    <p>Heard about some corp stooge being chased out of the neighbourhood a few days ago. Guess old "Tilly" fed him the wrong lines? I almost hope they try again - we're oppressed, not stupid.</p>
       <h2>July 30th</h2>
    <p>Y'know what? Screw their stupid new date system. It's July 30th, and any year numbered with an X can rot.</p>
       <h2>August 6th</h2>
    <p>Big week. Some shipping driver "accidentally" totaled one of the districts more crowded buildings, so a good few dozen people needed to find new digs in a hurry before any cops looking for a vagrant bonus came through. I let some guy crash at my place, but he cleared out first thing in the morning the next day. Couldn't stand the sound of a dozen server units, I guess. His loss.</p>
    <p>I'm sure it was a <em>complete coincidence</em> that the crash would just <em>happen</em> to be out here, in the middle of a district where no one owns a car, and not in the middle of the sardine can of skyscrapers over yonder.</p>
       <h2>August 13th</h2>
    <p>Hot damn - I was right about that "accident" last week. Just when it was starting to look like things might calm down out here again, the cops moved in like an army on Friday and practically tore the remains of the building where it happened to the ground. Some bullshit about "suspected disruptive activity". Idiots wouldn't find anything over there with twice as many guys on the ground, but that didn't stop it being seriously unnerving to see. They could knock over any old place out here and no one in the main city would give half a damn how it turned out. Not that they'd even know, anyway - I'm sure their best pal Tilly would make sure they never heard a hint of it.</p>
       <h2>August 20th</h2>
    <p>-</p>
        <h2>August 27th</h2>
    <p>Sorry for no entry last week, but no need for anyone to worry. I kept things as quiet as I could on account of the city cops still crawling all over the place. They've gone back to their usual corporate bootlicking positions by now, so we should be in the clear again.</p>
    <p>Think I might have a chance to expand the site in the coming months. I've made a few friends thanks to the buzz caused by everything that's happened recently. Didn't think I'd be turning this place into a team endeavour, but sometimes life surprises you. More to come.</p>
